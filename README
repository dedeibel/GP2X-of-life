 Synopsis
------

GP2XOfLife is a simple implentation of "Conway's Game of Life" for the GP2X.

From Wikipedia:

	The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British
	mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example
	of a cellular automaton.
	
	The "game" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is
	determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players.
	One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration
	and observing how it evolves.
	
	*** Rules
	
	The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional grid of
	cells, each of which is either alive or dead. Cells interact with their
	eight neighbours, which are the cells that are directly horizontally,
	vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following
	effects occur:
	
	 1. Any live cell with fewer than two neighbours dies, as if by loneliness.
	 2. Any live cell with more than three neighbours dies, as if by
	    overcrowding.
	 3. Any live cell with two or three neighbours lives, unchanged, to the
	    next generation.
	 4. Any dead cell with exactly three neighbours comes to life.
	
	The initial pattern constitutes the first generation of the system.
	The second generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously
	to every cell in the first generation -- births and deaths happen
	simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes
	called a tick. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create
	further generations.
	
See Wikipedia [1] for more information about what Game of Life is.

 Savegames
------

The current state of the world can be saved in one of 5 slots. The first
slot is automatically loaded on game start. Savegames can be manually edited,
make sure to use only '.' for a dead and 'x' representing a living cell.

After loading the view is allways set to the center of the world. Saving the
game might take a couple of seconds.

This is free software, the sourcecode is available on archive.gp2x.de under
the terms of the gpl.

Happy living.
